How do I approach designing software?
      What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
      What design process did you follow for your project work?
      How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
      
This class has taught me about modeling in 3D and in specific how to think about a 2D image in 3D. I tried to follow a process of just making sure to keep organized and breaking the project up into the simplest parts and working on it from the ground up. I think that will be a valuable process to apply to other forms of programming as if you plan out a process from the most basic to the most complex you can start any project room an advantageous position.
      
How do I approach developing programs?
      What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
      How did iteration factor into your development?
      How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
      
I try to approach developing programs by making a plan before I do anything then executing the plan. While working on my 3D scene i really tried to break down the code into small digestible parts while planning. by breaking the project up into stages i was really able to think about each part and continually improve them until i got to the final project leading to a better overall product.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
      How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
      
Computer science will help me reach my goals in life because I genuinely enjoy programming and am looking forward to making a career out of it. The skills that i learned in this job give me a better knowledge about programming as a whole and how programs that i was less familiar with work.
